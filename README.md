# Assignment Notes 
This is your first assignment (after the Logo quiz).  The files in this zip file are the ones you'll want to use as a template for your assignment.

## Using the files
To use these, simply unzip the contents folder onto your computer.  This will create a folder called assignment2 which contains all the files you need to complete the assignment.

Once you have unzipped all the files you can open the week3.js, week4.js and week5.js files and paste your exercise code directly from P5JS into the places indicated.  There is a video on the unit web site that shows you how to do this.

Don't forget to edit this README.md file as specified in the assignment notes.  You can add any comments here about the challanges you faced, anything you were proud of and so on.  This will help us understand how engaged you were with the assignment.

(Note: This file is in markdown format, if you've never used it before have a look at a markdown syntax guide, they're easy to find.)

To submit, simply zip your assignment1 folder a d submit the zipfile.  Instructions on creating a zip file on Mac and PC is available on the unit web site.

## Editing the CSS and HTML

If you do not edit the CSS and HTML your web pages are going to look pretty ugly and boring.  To demonstrate your engagement, and your rejection of bad design, you are encouraged to edit the HTML and CSS to make your pages look better.  Just be careful not to break the links or the bits that make your sketches display.
